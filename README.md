# click-game

This is a single page React App that contains a simple Simpsons memory card game.  The user is displayed 16 different images of Simpsons characters when the page loads.  If the user can click each character's picture only once, they win the game.  If a picture is clicked twice the user loses the round and the game is reset.  This is my first React build and I learned a lot about components and state from it.

I used the create-react-app package for the initial setup and gh-pages to deploy.  

Here's a screenshot of the game:
